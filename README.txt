# TFX: Then & Now — Fan Project (EN-only)

This is a lightweight static site to compare **TFX (1993)** scenes with **2025** reimagined artwork.

## How to use
- Replace or add images in `assets/img/`. Originals are named `tfx_*.gif|webp`, modern counterparts end with `_now.png`.
- To adjust pairings/captions, edit `index.html` — sections **Reimagined** and **Gallery**.

## Hosting
Any static hosting works (GitHub Pages, Netlify, your server).  
**GitHub Pages quick start:** push the folder to a repo → Settings → Pages → Branch: `main`, folder: `/root`.
