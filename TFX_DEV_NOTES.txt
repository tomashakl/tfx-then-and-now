TFX — Then & Now (2025)
Internal Development Notes
===========================================

1. Project Goal
-------------------------------------------
Create a functional and visually modern template for a "Then & Now / Reimagined" website concept, focused on classic PC games from the DOS and early Windows era (up to ~2000).

The first completed example: **TFX — Then & Now (2025)**

Objective: achieve a complete, modular, and easily duplicable version that can be used for future titles within the same design system.


2. Development Summary
-------------------------------------------
1. Base Layout & Structure
   - Files: `index.html`, `styles.css`, `main.js`
   - Unified folder `/assets/` (no `/img/` subfolder)
   - All paths relative for portability (works on subdirectories or GitHub Pages)
   - Responsive layout with dark theme and neon-accent color (#11E1F3)

2. Main Page Elements
   - Hero header with logo and title “TFX — Reimagined 2025”
   - Interactive before/after compare slider
   - Then & Now gallery (hover/tap image flip between 1993/2025)
   - “Why TFX Was Ahead of Its Time” section with detailed bullet points
   - “About this Fan Project” footer section with visible links:
       • Age of Pixels — Project
       • Contact (mailto link)
   - Back-to-top button styled to match the website theme

3. Functional JavaScript Features
   - Compare slider (mouse, touch, click support)
   - Lightbox viewer with navigation and ESC close
   - Flipcard hover effect for desktop / tap for mobile
   - Clean vanilla JS, no third-party libraries

4. CSS Highlights
   - Consistent accent color #11E1F3
   - Modern fluid layout (grid, flex)
   - `.links` section visible and styled
   - Fixed gallery aspect ratio 16:9
   - Subtle transitions and consistent typography

5. SEO and Technical Enhancements
   - Added `<meta description>`, `robots`, `theme-color`, `og:*`, and `apple-touch-icon`
   - `decoding="async"` + `fetchpriority="high"` for hero image
   - Structured data (JSON-LD, CreativeWork)
   - Lazy loading for all gallery images
   - Canonical and OG URLs point to GitHub Pages (to be changed later to Age of Pixels subpath)

6. Integration Plan (Future)
   - Final structure under: `/fan-projects/tfx/`
   - More projects to follow (EF2000, Jane’s ATF, etc.)
   - Each project will reuse the same HTML/CSS/JS skeleton and layout conventions

7. GitHub Repository Notes
   - This file (`TFX_DEV_NOTES.txt`) is for internal reference
   - It is safe to include in the repository but not linked from any visible page
   - Optionally exclude from indexing via `.gitignore` if needed

8. Current Status (October 2025)
   - Functional version completed
   - All major interactive components working correctly
   - Visual and layout consistency verified
   - Remaining work: minor cosmetic adjustments and polish (spacing, shadows, subtle effects)
